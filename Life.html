                Cognitive function and decision-making abilities are significantly impaired by lack of sleep. Sleep-deprived students often exhibit decreased reaction times, 
                impaired judgment, and reduced creativity. This can lead to poor academic choices, such as procrastination or ineffective study strategies, as well as risky 
                behaviors in their personal lives.

                Social and relationship problems can also stem from chronic sleep deprivation. Irritability, mood swings, and decreased empathy are common side effects of insufficient sleep, 
                which can strain friendships, romantic relationships, and interactions with peers and professors.
