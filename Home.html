                <p>“I Can Sleep When I’m Dead” is a fun simple website that is meant to teach the reader about the effect of sleep 
                    deprivation and the negative effects it can have on people. Enjoy the interesting facts and relax as you learn 
                    more about sleep deprivation at your own pace. On this main page you will learn about some causes of sleep
                    deprivation with the Life and Health page each discussing some the effects of sleep deprivation.

                    How does it start? Well sleep deprivation is when a person does not get enough sleep at night and comes from a variety of factors. 
                    Many people are willing to sacrifice some sleep to stay up for some fun, or to try and catch up on some work or homework but 
                    skipping good sleep can compound onto the next day and make that person less productive creating a cycle. According to “Effects of Sleep Deprivation” 
                    written by Rob Newsom “Nearly half of people in the U.S. have trouble sleeping, and around one-third of adults sleep less than seven hours each night.”

                    All this skipping on sleep isn’t very good for people, and it also causes humans to accrue “sleep debt.” In “How Sleep Deprivation Affects the Human Body” 
                    by Brandon Peters he explains that “Sleep debt is the amount of sleep lost from insufficient sleep, regardless of the cause. For example, if you need eight hours 
                    of sleep to feel fully rested but only clock six hours, you have a two-hour sleep deficit for that night. This may have important health consequences as the debt builds.” 
                    As “sleep debt” as Brandon Peters puts it can add up much more quickly than people think and simply can’t be wiped away with one good night of sleep. 
                    It’s important to have a consistent sleep schedule or else human beings will start to degrade their bodies and minds. Please check the Health and Life 
                    sections to learn about how the lack of sleep can affect you.
