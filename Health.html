                            Mental health consequences of sleep deprivation are equally concerning. Lack of sleep has been linked to increased rates of anxiety, depression,
                            and mood disorders among college students. The relationship between sleep and mental health is bidirectional, with poor sleep exacerbating mental health 
                            issues and mental health problems often leading to disrupted sleep patterns.

                            Physical health issues also arise from chronic sleep deprivation. Students who consistently skimp on sleep are more susceptible to illnesses due to a weakened immune system. 
                            They may also experience weight gain, as lack of sleep disrupts hormones that regulate appetite and metabolism. In extreme cases, prolonged sleep deprivation can even lead to more severe health consequences.

                            •	A 36% greater risk for colorectal cancer
                            •	A 33% greater dementia risk
                            •	A 48% greater risk of developing heart disease
                            •	Nearly a 3X greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes
                            •	A 50% higher risk of developing obesity
                            •	A 3X greater likelihood of catching a cold
